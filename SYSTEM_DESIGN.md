**System Overview:**

The system captures video frames from a webcam, processes them for motion detection, captures images of detected motion, and sends email notifications with the captured images.

**Components:**

1. **Main Application (main.py):**
   - Imports OpenCV for webcam access and image processing.
   - Initializes the webcam and waits for a brief time to stabilize the camera.
   - Captures frames from the webcam and converts them to grayscale.
   - Compares the grayscale frame with the first captured frame to detect changes (motion).
   - Applies thresholding to identify significant differences in pixel values.
   - Uses contour detection to identify areas of motion.
   - Saves the current frame as an image if motion is detected.
   - Uses threading to initiate email sending and folder cleaning processes.

2. **Email Sending Module (emailing.py):**
   - Imports smtplib for sending emails.
   - Uses Gmail's SMTP server for email communication.
   - Authenticates with the sender's Gmail account using their credentials (email and password).
   - Constructs an email message with a predefined subject and content.
   - Reads the image file from the specified path and attaches it to the email.
   - Sends the email notification to the specified recipient (sender's own email).

3. **Threading:**
   - Utilizes Python's threading module to run multiple processes concurrently.
   - Two threads are used: one for sending emails and another for cleaning the images folder.
   - Threading prevents the main application from freezing during email sending and folder cleaning.

**Folder Structure:**
- `images/`: Stores captured images of detected motion.
- `main.py`: Main application for motion detection and email notification.
- `emailing.py`: Email sending module.
- `readme.md`: Instructions for setting up and using the system.

**Communication Flow:**
1. Webcam captures video frames.
2. Frames are processed for motion detection.
3. If motion is detected, the current frame is saved as an image in the "images" folder.
4. A thread for sending emails is initiated, and the captured image path is passed.
5. The email sending thread constructs and sends an email notification with the attached image.
6. Concurrently, a thread for cleaning the "images" folder is initiated to remove captured images.

**Advantages:**
- Real-time motion detection for security and monitoring purposes.
- Email notifications provide instant alerts about detected motion.
- Threading ensures smooth execution without freezing the main application.

**Considerations:**
- Security: Protect email credentials and ensure secure email communication.
- Robustness: Handle exceptions and edge cases to prevent unexpected behavior.

This system design outlines the key components, communication flow, and benefits of the "Motion Detection and Email Notification System." It demonstrates a practical application of computer vision and email integration for enhancing security and monitoring capabilities.
